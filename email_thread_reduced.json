The decision is being handed down \napproximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan \nSumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  \n(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to \ndo the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning \nthe Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the \nindividual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a \ndecision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not \nwriting the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the \nruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently \nlikelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are \nunlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we \nbelieve we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up \nvalue by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not \nmake an offer of settlement.  \n\nWe expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement \nwill be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each \nof you is contacted as soon as possible with the result."

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties \napproximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final \nfigure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the \nprincipal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take \nas long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part \nof the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The \nopinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" \nrather than applying the provisions of the contract.  \n\nFor example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that \nthe  \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after \npayments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are \nunacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow \nJ-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and \ntherefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says \nthat the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature \nof a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.\n\nAs far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that \nthe clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The \ncontract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it \nis only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the \nTransportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price \nreduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This \nstatement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the \nopinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties \nhave an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.\n\nEqually disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our \nsubmission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the \nrestitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon \nwhich the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point \nat the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have \nbeen a given. \n\nAlthough I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our \nother counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and \ndescribe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\".  \nUnfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country \n(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for \nrecourse.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or \nexpected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from \neach of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster \nride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in \nfact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. \n\nPlease call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if \nyou wish to have a copy of the opinion.

One of their \nprincipal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies \nrecently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services \nto other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in \nArizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me \nconfidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the \ninterconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that \ninterconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power \nPlant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide \ncontract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked \nin writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these \nfacilities. \n\nDoes TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for \nCitizens?  In a related legal\/regulatory question, does TW have the authority \nto conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform \nthese services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an \naffiliate problem for us if we \"share\" operating employees?  If these \nthreshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide \ncontract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do \nso, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear \nat first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, \nremember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and \nEPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure \nbetween the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts \nfrom both pipes as well as the plant site. \n\nAlthough I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards \ntransportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of \nthis negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.

I further assume that we \nshould roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty \nunder this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set \nas 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the \nsame amount.\n\n\nPlease give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,\n\nKind Regards,\n\nkarolina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 17\/05\/2001 15:44 CDT\nTo: Rod Nelson\/LON\/ECT@ECT, Karolina Moran\/LON\/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rhett Jackson\/Enron@EnronXGate \n\nSubject: Re: Enron Teeside Operating Limited (\"ETOL\")\n\nFYI\n\nSara Shackleton\nEnron North America Corp.\n1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a\nHouston, Texas  77002\n713-853-5620 (phone)\n713-646-3490 (fax)\nsara.shackleton@enron.com\n----- Forwarded by Sara Shackleton\/HOU\/ECT on 05\/17\/2001 03:43 PM -----\n\n\tJorge A Garcia@ENRON\n\t05\/17\/2001 03:26 PM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton\/HOU\/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Re: Enron Teeside Operating Limited (\"ETOL\")\n\nGood Afternoon Sara,\n\nI have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following \ninformation for you.

Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the \nGMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have \nproven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. \nEnron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the \nmany people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  \n Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and \nit was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in \nTexas, such as myself.  \n\nRegards,\n\nBen Rogers"

The\n            party  refuses  to  give  his  name  or  phone  number.  His  \nreply  has  been  \"If  I  have  to  give  my  name\n            and  number  maybe  I  don't  need  your  confirm\",  then  he  \nhangs  up.  He  has  called  several  times  since\n            I  stopped  you  and  Bob  Bowen  earlier.  I  also  suspect  \nthat  this  same  party  has  been  calling  and  \n            hanging  up  without  answering;  and  calling  from  a  \ndifferent  outside  line  pretending  to  be  someone  else,\n            but  making  the  same  deal  request ,  followed  by  hanging  \nup  when  I  ask  for  his  name  and  phone\n            number.  I  have  contacted  Susan  Flynn  in  legal  to  \ninquire  about  these  calls  or  BP Amoco.  I  was  advised\n            not  to  send  any  confirms  out  blindly  and  that  I  was  \nhandling  it  just  right .  Susan  is  currently  inquiring\n            with  the  other  legal  staff  and  attorneys  about  the  \nmatter.  I  also  was  advised  to  inform  you  to  make  \n            other  members  of  our  team  aware  \"not  to  send  out  blind  \ninformation  requests\" .  The  party  was  calling \n            from  (281)493-0214.  I  will  keep  you  informed.\n\n            Thanks,\n            \n            Willie\n\n\n"

I do not see \nanything in their response that addresses this issue.\n(6)  HPL has nothing to do with the abandoned and unused portions of the \nSeacrest pipeline to Dow or Tejas, and certainly would not be in a legal \nposition to represent such abandonment for something it does not own.\n(7)  This is fine if we can reach settlement.\n(8)  This is fine if we can reach settlement.\n\nIn light of the AEP transaction closing Friday, should Dan now become our \npoint person on this and respond?"

This communication \nalso included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network \ndue to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.\n\nIt is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% \nincrease in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to \nyou and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter \nproposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.\n\nWhile this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, \nEnron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation \nefforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it \nis our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group \nand may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  \n\nMany doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals \nwithin the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those \nwith admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake \nHospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our \naffected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO \noptions, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between \nSeptember 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial \nHermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network \nbenefits applied.

There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under \nthis category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are \nhitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  \nCurrently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  \nThe problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these \ncounterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the \nproducts after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 \/ EOL #555401.\n\nRISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies \nwith Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two \nlegs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment \nof FT-US\/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US\/CAND-ERMS to the \nappropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for \nFinancial Swaps and not Physical deals.  \n\nIT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked \ncorrectly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will \nmost likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg \nMaintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk\/Global to \ninstruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so \nlogic can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nDoes a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any \nfurther issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    \nPlease respond with your thoughts on this subject.\n\nThank you,\nDawn\n3-9353\n\n\n\n"

Since the second\nsentence seems to be somewhat problematic for Enron, we will withdraw our\nrequest for that sentence.  My only other change would be that the \".1\"\nappearing after the \"4\" and the \"11\" in the last sentence should also be\ndeleted.\n\nHopefully this will resolve the issue.\n\nBest regards,  Beth\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com [mailto:Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com]\nSent: Thursday, March 08, 2001 5:33 PM\nTo: WebbB@dsmo.com\nSubject: Re: Enron\/GISB Contract\n\n\n\nBeth,\n\nWe will agree to this version with the following changes:\n\n\"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is\npurchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the \"Repurchasers\") to\nwhom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition\nto any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force\nmajeure\npursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be\nentitled\nto claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable\nto take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such\nDelivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term \"Transporter\"\nwhen used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1.\nand 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter\nfor any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply\nto invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such\nTransporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received\nby NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the\nsame\nvolumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such\nRepurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).\"\n\n\nPlease let me have your thoughts.\n\n\nRegards,\nDebra Perlingiere\nEnron North America Corp.\nLegal Department\n1400 Smith Street, EB 3885\nHouston, Texas 77002\ndperlin@enron.com\nPhone 713-853-7658\nFax  713-646-3490\n\n\n\n============================================================================Th\nis e-mail message and any attached files are confidential and are intended \nsolely for the use of the addressee(s) named above.

I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as\nfollows:\n\n   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.\n   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be\n   exempt from paying for the bonds.\n\nIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from\ntheir ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services\nfrom their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it\nwouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.\n\n   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power\n   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power\n   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.\n\nFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying\npower but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would\nonly be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took\nplace from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.\n\nI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that\ntook place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree\nduring the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able\nto agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which\ncan create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that\nwe include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill\nclarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\n\nIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with\nincentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it\nfinds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to\nswitch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short\nposition that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby\nreducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity\npurchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment\nto the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that\nswitches to Direct Access by September 1st.\n\nFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct\nAccess is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,\nthat seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.

I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as\nfollows:\n\n   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.\n   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be\n   exempt from paying for the bonds.\n\nIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from\ntheir ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services\nfrom their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it\nwouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.\n\n   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power\n   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power\n   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.\n\nFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying\npower but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would\nonly be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took\nplace from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.\n\nI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that\ntook place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree\nduring the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able\nto agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which\ncan create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that\nwe include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill\nclarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\n\nIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with\nincentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it\nfinds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to\nswitch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short\nposition that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby\nreducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity\npurchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment\nto the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that\nswitches to Direct Access by September 1st.\n\nFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct\nAccess is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,\nthat seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And\nif that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the\nbill?\n\nLook forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and\npassage of the \"core\/noncore\" proposal.\n\nBest,\nJeff\nThis e-mail is intended solely for use of the individual to whom it is\naddressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential or\notherwise exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have \none prepared.

Frankly, unless \nand until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and \nfinancial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations \nare, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For \nexample:\n\n (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee \nthey were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to \naccept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking \nfor a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and \nwarranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon \nthis disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may \nhave a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by \nvoice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a \nlong form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact \nbeen provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.\n\n (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the \nEnron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I \nnow understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the \nEnron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.\n\n (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of \nenforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect \nto the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron \nCorp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect \nto the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas\/New York) being enforceable.\n\n (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to \nme that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to \nEnron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal \nopinions.\n\n (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of \nthe underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I \nsuggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.\n\n (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the \nBank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of \nSwapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.\n\n (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this \nafternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This \npresents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps \ninvolving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At \nthe same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be \ncapable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation \nthrough broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.\n\n (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on \nthe credit\/collateralization\/margin requirements, which I think is dependent \nupon a final understanding of the swap structure.\n\n (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not \nclear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap \nstructure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the \nprincipal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \n\"fee letter\" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not \nclear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap \nstructure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions \nthat if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a \nchange in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those \nincreased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be \naccommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to \nfix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes \nor through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\".\n\n (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the \npaper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For \nexample, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements \nand related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in \nHouston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have \nalready been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs \nto be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & \nGraydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the \nBank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on \nfinalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants \npackage.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, \nthat the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same \nas the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank \nof Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper \nas soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon \nas possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.\n\nFrankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a \nmeasure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external \nexpectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all \nrelevant groups (i.e. Legal\/Global Finance\/Credit\/Origination) on Monday \nmorning.\n\nRegards,\nPeter"

Guarantee governed by New York law.\n\n (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of \nenforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect \nto the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron \nCorp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect \nto the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas\/New York) being enforceable.\n\n (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to \nme that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to \nEnron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal \nopinions.\n\n (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of \nthe underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I \nsuggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.\n\n (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the \nBank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of \nSwapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.\n\n (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this \nafternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This \npresents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps \ninvolving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At \nthe same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be \ncapable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation \nthrough broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.\n\n (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on \nthe credit\/collateralization\/margin requirements, which I think is dependent \nupon a final understanding of the swap structure.\n\n (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not \nclear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap \nstructure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the \nprincipal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \n\"fee letter\" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not \nclear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap \nstructure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions \nthat if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a \nchange in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those \nincreased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be \naccommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to \nfix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes \nor through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\".\n\n (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the \npaper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For \nexample, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements \nand related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in \nHouston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have \nalready been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs \nto be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & \nGraydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the \nBank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on \nfinalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants \npackage.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, \nthat the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same \nas the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank \nof Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper \nas soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon \nas possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.\n\nFrankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a \nmeasure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external \nexpectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all \nrelevant groups (i.e. Legal\/Global Finance\/Credit\/Origination) on Monday \nmorning.\n\nRegards,\nPeter"

It seems to me that we both need to \nfinalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that \nwe all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of \nnext week.\n\n1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap \nstructure including the credit and covenant package.\n\n2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have \none prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global \nFinance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its \nexternal counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, \ndocuments, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or \nexchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among \neach other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless \nand until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and \nfinancial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations \nare, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For \nexample:\n\n (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee \nthey were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to \naccept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking \nfor a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and \nwarranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon \nthis disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may \nhave a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by \nvoice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a \nlong form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact \nbeen provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.\n\n (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the \nEnron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I \nnow understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the \nEnron Corp.

As it is essentiaIly an Enron Corp. credit, I \nwould fiercely oppose this, but it is a commercial issue.  If it is to be \nincluded, the issue is not the occurrence of the event of default, but \nexercise of termination as a result of an event of default, and then only if \nthe exercise of the right of termination is finally determined to have been \nvalidly exercised.  But as I say, I would tell the Bank to get stuffed.\n\n2.  X-default to Enron Corp. Credit Agreement.  Again this is a commercial \nissue, but if the Bank is getting the longer form Guarantee this is not \nnecessary.  This could however fix to the requirement for the longer form \nGuarantee, if the Bank will take a plain vanilla short form Enron Corp. \nGuarantee with the x-default.  In any event, if this concept is to be \nincluded, it similarly would need to be qualified to acceleration as a result \nof an event of default under the Enron Corp. Credit Facilities.  Frankly, if \nClement is prepared on the longer form Enron Corp. Guarantee, I would tell \nthe Bank to get stuffed.\n\n3.  X-Default if the Enron Corp. Credit Agreement is determined to be \nunenforceable.  Unless I am missing something, this is ridiculous.\n\n4.  The Bank wants to \"syndicate\" the exposure which might include Schedule \nII Canadian Chartered Banks, and which might increase the Bank's cost of \nfunding.  Therefore they want to build a price escalator into the swaps.  \nAgain, this is a business issue, but if it is to be included it will be a \ndifficult concept in the context of the swaps, as opposed to a syndicated \nloan.  The price escalator will be complicated enough, as well as \nincorporating syndication rights and obligations on terms satisfactory to \nEnron, such as to which financial institutions, % of permitted syndication, \nleast cost alternatives, exercise of agent and majority rights, and recourse \nfor defaults by the Bank (i.e. unlike a loan we are taking credit risk of the \nBank as counterparty on the swaps).\n\nThe Bank's counsel did not seem to want to give a legal opinion on the Bank \nbut was willing on Swapco.  I would insist on getting it from the Bank, as \nagain this is not a loan but a swap on which we are taking the Bank's credit \nexposure.  I am not sure of the status of the requirement for a Bank \nguarantee if RBC DS is the counterparty rather then Bank.\n\nPlease let me know. "

On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent\nGoverning Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty\nreasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I\nthink we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that\nthe Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always\nbe 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more\nlikely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws\nregarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more\nequitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.\n\nBut aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about\nDSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the\nfall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are\nall preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to\nmarket; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC\nservices and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are\nmuch better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are\nbeing preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And\nas to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know\nwhat the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in\nagreement with our position.\n\nIn most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the\nresult of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of\nthe Enron physical rights model over the years).\n\nThere are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but\noverall, we stand to win on most of them.\n\nSo: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require\nthe CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate\nauthority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could\nbe up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into\npitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets\nrid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by\nthe state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in\nMarch\/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.\n\nCarl\n______\n\nMary.Hain@enron.com wrote:\n>\n> I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled\n> by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects\n> of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.

On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent\nGoverning Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty\nreasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I\nthink we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that\nthe Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always\nbe 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more\nlikely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws\nregarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more\nequitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.\n\nBut aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about\nDSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the\nfall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are\nall preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to\nmarket; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC\nservices and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are\nmuch better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are\nbeing preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And\nas to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know\nwhat the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in\nagreement with our position.\n\nIn most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the\nresult of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of\nthe Enron physical rights model over the years).\n\nThere are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but\noverall, we stand to win on most of them.\n\nSo: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require\nthe CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate\nauthority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could\nbe up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into\npitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets\nrid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by\nthe state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in\nMarch\/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.\n\nCarl\n______\n\nMary.Hain@enron.com wrote:\n>\n> I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled\n> by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects\n> of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.

We will leave on Sunday \n(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  \nThen our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.

In March, we receive every type of weather.  One\nday we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a\npass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass\ndoes not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I\ncould use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited\nuse (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do\nnot know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by\nchance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I\nsome money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to\nWinter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the\nresorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter\nPark\/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge.\n\nI have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even\nthough I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone\nand Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared\nto 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far\nthe best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night\nlife (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into\ntown, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is\nCopper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just\nlet me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day\nyou leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the\nrehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming\nup in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a\nroom available.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want\nto do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as\nwell.\n\nIf you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check\nhere for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't\nmeet up with you.\n\nYou guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the\nsummertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming\nout again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and\nKim loved it.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you.\n\nSean\n\n\n"

Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.\n\n2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  \n\n\"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out\" \n\"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade\" \n\"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for\" \n\"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type\" \n\"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here\" \n\n\nFrom a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said \"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. \n\nThe latest is the most disturbing:\n\n\"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude\" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed\n\nWe do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the \"backoffice\"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).\n\nWe have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  \n\nAll the problems are being caused by the following:\n\n1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.\n\nThere are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.\n\nMichelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.\n\n2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  \n\nWe also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.\n\n2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.\n\n2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. \n\n3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  \n\n4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "

Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.\n\n2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  \n\nWe also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.\n\n2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.\n\n2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. \n\n3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  \n\n4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "

What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be \ngoing down there on no sleep.

CDWR gave us an option \nuntil Mar28 to extend the deal for five years (at a lower price).  This gives \nus the opportunity to work out the credit issues.  \n\nI plan on speaking with Freeman early next week to re-engage on credit issues \n\/ Pastoria \/ other deals.  \n\nChris\n\n\n\n"

She\nobviouly has not done that.\n\n2.\tThe day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to\ntake to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in\nDaddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his\nestate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had\nnot been formally appointed.\n\n3.\tGlenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to\npay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm\nsurprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.\n\nWith regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to\ncourt, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:\n\n1.\tThe money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put\nback in to the estate.\n\n2.\tThe estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.\n\n3.\tThe value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her\ndistribution.\n\n4.\tThe repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April\n1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the\nestate.\n\n5.\tIf the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's\ndeath, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.\n\n6.\tAny excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as\nexecutrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.\n\n7.\tGlenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my\nfamily.\n\nI am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing\nto allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's\ndeath.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I\nwill allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left\nto me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he\nwas in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the\nvalue of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,\nbut that she did not put in the estate.\n\nI mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very\nbusy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a\nnew one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.\n\nI'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.\n\nDianne\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Tammy Irons [mailto:tammy@ironslawfirm.com]\nSent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:09 PM\nTo: Love, Dianne\nSubject: RE: Estate\n\n\nDianne\n\nI have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.

I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease\n   the\n   house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She\n   obviouly has not done that.\n\n   2.      The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to\n   take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in\n   Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his\n   estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and\n   had\n   not been formally appointed.\n\n   3.      Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him\n   to\n   pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm\n   surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.\n\n   With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to\n   court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:\n\n   1.      The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are\n   put\n   back in to the estate.\n\n   2.      The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.\n\n   3.      The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her\n   distribution.\n\n   4.      The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in\n   April\n   1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of\n   the\n   estate.\n\n   5.      If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's\n   death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.\n\n   6.      Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as\n   executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.\n\n   7.      Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me\n   and my\n   family.\n\n   I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am\n   willing\n   to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's\n   death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as\n   his.  I\n   will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy\n   left\n   to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while\n   he\n   was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay\n   the\n   value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car\n   for,\n   but that she did not put in the estate.\n\n   I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been\n   very\n   busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need\n   a\n   new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.\n\n   I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.\n\n   Dianne\n\n   -----Original Message-----\n   From: Tammy Irons [mailto:tammy@ironslawfirm.com]\n   Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:09 PM\n   To: Love, Dianne\n   Subject: RE: Estate\n\n\n   Dianne\n\n   I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.

It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships.  \nThe only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency \nrelationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some \nspecific documentation that she got signed.

As far as our friends go: Bryan Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b\/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  Matt Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; Tim Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; Chad got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to India to teach English to young Indians (how crazy is she?); and Shanna still has a job at Enron in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.\n \nI think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to Lenny and know his situation.  How is Hector holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.\n \nBTW, Jason (my bro) get married in February.\n \nKeep in touch-\nEric\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Brian Hoskins [mailto:bthoskins@hotmail.com]\nSent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 2:03 PM\nTo: Bass, Eric\nSubject: Re: What's Up\n\n\n\nEric,\n\nGood to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  \n\nGlad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  \n\nMy dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  \n\nEnjoy the downtime while you have it.
